# Color Switcher

Hosted on Netlify: https://diy-color-switcher.netlify.app/

NOTE: I noticed that some users have issues with the app not looking exactly as it is supposed to be (no background input and only foreground input) and some users don't have issues, so if there are issues for you simply clone the repo then run on your browser and everything will be good. 

Description: Visually appealing app implemented in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS where users can change the color of the background and the foreground to any color of their choosing (this app is like a DIY design app). The 3 options given to the user are:

1) Name: User enters a color by its name (orange, blue, etc) and the colors get changed to that.
   
2) Hex: User enters a color by its hex code and the colors get chaged to that.

3) Palette: User selects a color instead of entering it. This is done by the magic of a color palette.

In addition to this, all the JavaScript code is documented well with comments and follows good code structure.
