# Color Switcher

Description: App where users can change the color of the background and the foreground to any color of their choosing (this app is like a DIY design app). The 3 options given to the user are: 1) Name: User enters a color by its name (orange, blue, etc) and the colors get changed to that. 2) Hex: User enters a color by its hex code and the colors get chaged to that. 3) Palette: User selects a color instead of entering it. This is done by the magic of a color palette.
