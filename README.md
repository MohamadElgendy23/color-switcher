# Color Switcher

Hosted on Netlify: https://diy-color-switcher.netlify.app/

NOTE: The above netlify link has cache issues so the background color is not changing, but the foreground is. Just clone the repo and run on your localhost and browser to see the complete solution (both background and foreground colors changing). 

Visually appealing app where users can change the color of the background and the foreground to any color of their choosing (this app is like a DIY design app). The 3 options given to the user are:

1) Name: User enters a color by its name (orange, blue, etc) and the colors get changed to that.
   
2) Hex: User enters a color by its hex code and the colors get chaged to that.

3) Palette: User selects a color instead of entering it. This is done by the magic of a color palette.

In addition to this, all the JavaScript code is documented well with comments and follows good code structure.
